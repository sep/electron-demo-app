# electron-demo-app

![Workflow status](https://github.com/sep/electron-demo-app/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg)

This is a demonstration of an Electron desktop app with basic CI/CD and cross-platform functionality.

Our goal with this app is to learn how to:

* structure a basic Electron app
* use TypeScript
* build installers for Linux, Mac, and Windows
* automated testing
* use the CI/CD functionality (workflows) of GitHub with an Electron app
